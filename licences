The WTX-OS startup sound begins with a futuristic hum, representing the cutting-edge technology and innovation behind the operating system. As the hum fades, a steady beat emerges, symbolizing the firm ownership and control you have over the system. Amidst the beat, a soft melody plays in the background, conveying stability and reliability. Finally, a distinctive chime rings out briefly, signifying the presence of a moderator or co-owner accessing the system, while ensuring that your ownership remains prominent and unchallenged.
